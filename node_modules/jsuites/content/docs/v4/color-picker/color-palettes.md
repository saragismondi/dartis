Color palettes
==============

We created a collection of pre-defined palettes can be used in your javascript color picker

```html
<html>
<script src="https://jsuites.net/v4/jsuites.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://jsuites.net/v4/jsuites.css" type="text/css" />

<input id="color-picker">

<script>
jSuites.color(document.getElementById('color-picker'), {
    palette: jSuites.palette('fire')
});
</script>
</html>
```
